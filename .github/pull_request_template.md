<!--
HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE 
1. Fill in all sections (something is better than nothing)
2. Run `python noma_scripts/pr_preparation_scripts.py` locally
3. Delete these instruction comments (what begins with `<!--`)  before submitting if desired (including this block)
4. Click on PREVIEW on the top bar to see how it will look for the reviewer

WHY IT MATTERS: 
- Consistency: Ensures every PR looks the same and provides the same level of detail. 
- Safety: Forces a check for security flaws (API keys) and code hygiene (debug prints) via the scripts. 
- Context: Helps reviewers understand *what* changed and *where* (dependencies), speeding up the approval process.

## 📌 Description
<!--Objective summary of the change and if there is no task/ticket, explain the necessity of what was done-->

## 🧠 Context
- **Type:** [Feature | Bugfix | Refactor | Chore | Hotfix] <!-- Choose one-->
- **Impacted Module/Flow:** <!--Ex: Checkout, Login, Payment API-->
- **Dependencies on another task/PR:** <!-- Is there a dependency on another task/PR? (Yes/No)-->
<!--
Chore: Technical maintenance tasks that do not alter user functionality (ex: updating libraries, configuring tools, code cleanup).
Hotfix: Urgent correction for a critical error already in production, applied immediately (bypassing the normal development flow).
